# Stanford CS231n – Assignment 1 Solutions (2025)

This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 1 of the course  
**CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision**.

The assignment focuses on building an image classification pipeline on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and implementing several core models from scratch using NumPy, without deep learning frameworks.

## Academic Integrity Notice

These notebooks are shared for **learning and reference only**.  
If you are currently taking CS231n, **please do not copy this work or submit it as your own**.

## Contents

The repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

### `knn.ipynb`
Implementation and experiments for the **k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)** classifier on CIFAR-10.

### `softmax.ipynb`
Implementation of a **Softmax classifier**, including vectorized loss and gradient, and hyperparameter tuning.

### `two_layer_net.ipynb`
Implementation of a **two-layer fully connected neural network** trained with backpropagation.

### `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb`
Implementation and training of **deeper fully connected networks**, including techniques like regularization and optimization strategies.

## Environment & Requirements

The code is based on the official **CS231n 2025 Assignment 1** starter notebooks and only relies on the standard Python scientific stack.

### Recommended environment

- Python 3.8+
- Google Colab

### Core Python packages

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
